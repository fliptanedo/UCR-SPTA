## How do I update this? (I'm new to GitHub)

Git and GitHub are standards for collaborative code editing. You may access these files by *cloning* them or *downloading* them from this page. If you clone your own copy of the repository, you can edit it on your own and update your local repository. You may then make a *pull request* to the owner of the `master` branch (this one) to incorporate changes. Git has version control built in and will help with resolving conflicts if the sources has been modified by multiple users.

**Do I have to use this?** No, but this is one of the the easiest and modern ways to collaboratively edit source code. 

## Who updates the public-facing website?

Currently, Prof. Flip Tanedo synchronizes the `master` branch of htis repository with the <a href="http://theory.ucr.edu/SPTA/">http://theory.ucr.edu/SPTA/</a> page.
